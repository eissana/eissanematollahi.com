#+TITLE: Machine Learning: Ensembles
#+SUBTITLE: Improving prediction power by combining weak learners

* Introduction
In my previous post [[https://eissanematollahi.com/2018/09/02/machine-learning-basic-workflow/][Machine Learning: Basic Workflow]], I explained the basic and common workflow of training and building a machine learning model. We also discussed how to estimate the prediction error of the trained model.
* Condorcet's Jury
* Ensemble Learners

#+caption: Ensemble learners may achieve nearly perfect performance by combining decisions of multiple weak learners that are only slightly better than a random predictor.
