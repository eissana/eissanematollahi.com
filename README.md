# My Personal Website Data

Visit my website at [eissanematollahi.com](eissanematollahi.com). I include all the source code for generating my blog posts here in this repository. 

I use emacs with [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) to write my blogs and upload them to my website using [org2blog](https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog). 

For graphs, I mainly use [tikz](http://www.texample.net/tikz/), but sometimes I may use [ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/), although it's very limited in functionality.
